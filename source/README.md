Honeycomb is a parser combinator library written in pure Nim. It's designed to be simple, straightforward, and easy to expand, while relying on zero dependencies from outside of Nim's standard library.

Honeycomb was heavily inspired by the excellent Python library [parsy](https://github.com/python-parsy/parsy), as well as the existing but unmaintained [combparser](https://github.com/PMunch/combparser).

```nim
let 
  parser  = ((s("Hello") | s("Greetings")) << c(',') << whitespace) & (regex(r"\w+") << c("!."))
  result1 = parser.parse("Hello, world!")
  result2 = parser.parse("Greetings, peasants.")

assert result1.kind  == success
assert result1.value == @["Hello", "world"]

assert result2.kind  == success
assert result2.value == @["Greetings", "peasants"]
```

Honeycomb supports the following key features:

- Predefined parsers and parser constructors for numerous basic parsing needs
- An extensive library of combinators with which to combine them
- Support for manually defining custom parsers / combinators
- Forward-declared parsers to support mutually recursive parser definitions

## Installation

You can install Honeycomb via Nim's package manager, `nimble`.

```bash
nimble install honeycomb
```

Once you've installed Honeycomb, you can use it in your project by importing it.

```nim
import honeycomb
```

## Usage

5. Make sure to add or update tests in [`tests/test.nim`](./tests/test.nim) to verify your changes.
6. Create a pull request with your changes.

Honeycomb has an extensive and expanding suite of unit tests, which can be found in [`tests/test.nim`](./tests/test.nim). You can run the tests with:
```bash
nimble test
```

To generate a local copy of the documentation from Honeycomb's code, you can use the following command. Note that the `docs` folder is intentionally `.gitignore`d and should not be committed; when your changes are merged into the `master` branch, an automated process will regenerate the documentation on the `docs` branch.
```bash
nimble gendocs
```
